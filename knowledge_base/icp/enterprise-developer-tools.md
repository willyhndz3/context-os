# Enterprise Developer Tools ICP

Enterprise software companies that sell API platforms, integration tools, or developer infrastructure. They have complex GTM motions because they sell to both technical (developers) and business buyers.

## Characteristics

- Product is technical (APIs, integrations, infrastructure)
- Audience includes developers, architects, engineering leaders
- Often have open-source or community component
- Long sales cycles with multiple stakeholders
- Compete against other established platforms

## Why They Need GTM Help

1. Hard to find the right buyers (developers don't fill out forms)
2. Community signals matter (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Discord)
3. Competitor displacement is a key motion
4. Need to enrich with technical signals, not just firmographics

## Channels That Matter

- GitHub activity and contributors
- Developer community engagement
- Technical content consumption
- Competitor product usage signals

## Evidence

> "Brett explored how these approaches could help Wso2 proactively engage prospects, enrich CRM data, and build more flexible workflows... target competitors' customers and developer communities"
> [VERIFIED: WSO2 call, Jan 2026]

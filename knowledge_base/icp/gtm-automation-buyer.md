# GTM Automation Buyer

B2B companies seeking to automate and scale their outbound go-to-market motions, typically through Clay-based workflows.

## Key Characteristics

- **Company Stage:** Early to growth stage, often bootstrapped or Series A-B
- **Team Size:** Small sales/marketing teams (1-5 people doing GTM)
- **Current State:** Manual list building, inconsistent data quality, limited automation
- **Trigger:** Missed targets, new leadership mandate, or seeing competitors use better tooling

## Validated Segments

### 1. SaaS Companies
- Need outbound to supplement inbound
- Often have RevOps or founder doing GTM
- Examples: Eraser.io, Primerli, Truce

### 2. Healthcare/Healthtech
- Complex ICPs requiring enrichment
- Need multi-source data (Definitive Healthcare, ZoomInfo)
- Examples: Flagler Health

### 3. Energy/Utilities
- Enterprise accounts with long sales cycles
- Need deep research and persona-segmented messaging
- Examples: eSmart Systems (targeting Texas utilities)

### 4. L&D/Training Companies
- Event-based outreach (conferences, trade shows)
- Need list enrichment and qualification
- Examples: The Regis Company (DevLearn campaign)

## Pain Points

1. **Manual processes** - Spending hours on list building and qualification
2. **Data quality** - CRM full of incomplete or stale records
3. **Email deliverability** - Getting blocked or low open rates
4. **No persona segmentation** - Same message to everyone
5. **Tool overwhelm** - Too many tools, no integration

## Buying Triggers

- Missed quarter or revenue target
- New CRO/VP Sales with modernization mandate
- Competitor using Clay or similar tools effectively
- Upcoming event/campaign with tight timeline

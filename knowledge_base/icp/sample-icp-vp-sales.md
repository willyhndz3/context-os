# VP of Sales Persona

The VP of Sales is typically the primary economic buyer in enterprise deals. They care most about revenue impact and team productivity.

## Key Points

- Reports to CRO or CEO
- Owns revenue targets and team quota
- Evaluates tools based on rep productivity and pipeline velocity
- Risk-averse; needs proof from similar companies

## Pain Points

1. **Rep ramp time** - New hires take too long to become productive
2. **Forecast accuracy** - Unpredictable pipeline makes planning hard
3. **Tool fatigue** - Team resistant to adopting another tool

## Buying Triggers

- Missed quarter
- New CRO with mandate to modernize
- Competitor win/loss that exposed gap

## Evidence

> "Replace with actual quote from customer interview"
> [SOURCE: Add source reference]

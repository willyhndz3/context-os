# Three Pillars of GTM Engineering

The GTM Factory's core framework for delivering go-to-market automation engagements. Strategy first, tooling second.

## The Framework

### Pillar 1: Strategizing
Understanding business goals and identifying new revenue streams. This is the key component - tooling is secondary to a well-defined strategy.

**Activities:**
- Map the full sales funnel (top, middle, bottom)
- Identify ICP and persona segments
- Define signals and triggers for outreach
- Understand existing tech stack and data sources

**Key Insight:** Most clients come asking for tooling help but actually need strategy clarification first.

### Pillar 2: Building
Mastering a central tool (Clay) to integrate various processes. Focus on creating workflows that can scale.

**Activities:**
- Clay table architecture and workflow design
- Multi-source data enrichment (ZoomInfo, Apollo, Definitive Healthcare, web scraping)
- CRM integration and data cleanup
- Deep research agents for account intelligence

**Key Insight:** Build modular workflows that can be iterated on quickly.

### Pillar 3: Executing & Iterating
Quick testing and iteration. Advise against holding onto projects that yield low results.

**Activities:**
- A/B test messaging and sequences
- Monitor deliverability and engagement
- Cut underperformers fast
- Document what works for reuse

**Key Insight:** Ship fast, measure immediately, iterate or kill quickly.

## Evidence

> "Willy Hernandez outlined three pillars for effective go-to-market engineering: strategizing, building, and executing/iterating. They emphasized that strategizing, which involves understanding business goals and identifying new revenue streams, is the key component, as tooling is secondary to a well-defined strategy."

## Application

This framework is used in:
1. **Discovery calls** - Assess where the client is weak
2. **Scoping engagements** - Structure SOWs around pillars
3. **Ongoing work** - Balance time across all three

# Pricing Objection

Prospects pushing back on the $125/hr rate or overall project cost. Common with early-stage companies and budget-constrained teams.

## The Objection

"Your rate is too high for our budget."
"We were thinking more like $100/hr."
"Can we do a fixed price instead?"

## Evidence

> "Insights Company expressed concern about the consulting rate, initially suggesting $100/hr due to budget constraints, but Willy has agreed to meet in the middle at $115/hr."
> [VERIFIED: Insightscompany deal]

> "Sravanthi has decided to move forward with another contractor for their initial GTM needs"
> [VERIFIED: Insightscompany deal - lost on rate]

## Response Framework

### 1. Anchor on Value, Not Hours
Don't compete on rate. Compete on outcomes.

**Say:** "The question isn't hourly rate - it's whether we can generate ROI. If this workflow generates 10 qualified meetings, what's that worth?"

### 2. Offer Scoped Alternatives
If budget is truly constrained, offer smaller scope:

| Option | Description | Price |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Use Case Coaching | 1:1 training on one workflow | $500 flat |
| Audit Only | Review existing setup, provide recommendations | 2-3 hrs |
| Phased Approach | Start small, expand if ROI proven | Project-based |

### 3. Flexible Rate for Right Fit
For strategic accounts or referral sources, can flex to $115/hr.

**Criteria for flexibility:**
- Strong referral potential
- Interesting use case for portfolio
- Long-term relationship potential

### 4. Walk Away Gracefully
If rate is the primary concern and value isn't landing, it's likely not a fit.

**Say:** "I totally understand budget constraints. Happy to reconnect when timing is better - I'll send over some resources in the meantime."

## Win/Loss Analysis

| Deal | Outcome | Rate Factor |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Insightscompany | Lost | Rate concern, went with cheaper option |
| The Regis Company | Won | Started small ($1K), expanded |
| eSmart Systems | Won | Value clear, no rate pushback |

## How It Relates

- [[gtm-automation-buyer]] - Early-stage segment most price-sensitive
- [[clay-workflow-service]] - Need to emphasize unique value vs. competitors
- [[three-pillars-methodology]] - Strategy differentiation justifies premium

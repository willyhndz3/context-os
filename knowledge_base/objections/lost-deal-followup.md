# Lost Deal Follow-Up

How to respond gracefully when you lose a deal - especially to a cheaper competitor on a tactical, price-sensitive engagement.

## When NOT to Chase

Don't pursue deals that are:
- **Tactical and small-scope** - "just optimize our list building"
- **Price-first conversations** - Rate is the first question, not value
- **Existing infra, minor tweaks** - They don't need strategic help
- **Heavy competitor shopping** - Talking to 3+ consultants on price

These buyers want a vendor, not a partner. Let them go.

## The Graceful Exit Email

When you lose to a cheaper option, respond with class. Don't negotiate further or chase.

### Template

```
Subject: Re: [original thread]

Hey [Name],

No worries at all. Sounds like you found a good fit for what you need right now.

Good luck with the outbound stuff. If things change or you ever want to bounce ideas around, you know where to find me.

Cheers,
Willy

### Why This Works

1. No desperation. You're not asking "what can I do to win this back"
2. Validates their decision without being stiff about it
3. Leaves door open casually
4. Short. Shows you're busy with other work

## What Often Happens Next

- Cheap contractor underdelivers
- They come back in 3-6 months with bigger budget and clearer scope
- Or they don't - and that's fine, wasn't your ICP anyway

## Evidence

> "After considering a few options, I've decided to move forward with another contractor for our initial GTM needs at this time... we're just in a unique position right now, since we have some existing infra and primarily want to explore optimizations"

## Qualification Lesson

Better to lose fast on price than win slow on a deal that drains you. The right clients pay for strategy, not just execution.

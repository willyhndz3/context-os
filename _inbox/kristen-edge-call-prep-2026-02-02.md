## Key Questions to Ask

### Understand the Opportunity

3. "What does success look like at the end of 5 months?"

### Assess Current State
4. "What's your current HubSpot setup? How long have you been on it?"
5. "Where are the biggest pain points today - is it the data not flowing in, or not knowing what to do with it?"
6. "You mentioned Zoom integration issues - what's breaking?"

### Scope & Fit
7. "Of these 5 workstreams, which is most critical to get right first?"
8. "Do you have internal HubSpot admin support, or would this contractor be the sole resource?"
9. "What's the decision process and timeline for selecting a contractor?"

### Strategic Alignment
10. "Tell me about your GTM plan - what are the main growth levers you're betting on?"

## Honest Fit Assessment

**What you do well:**
- GTM strategy and operating systems
- Clay-based automation workflows
- Outbound/prospecting infrastructure

**What this project is:**
- Heavy HubSpot technical implementation
- Marketing ops / RevOps consulting
- CMS integration work

**Options:**
1. **Pass** - Refer to HubSpot partner agency
2. **Partial scope** - Take strategic advisory piece only
3. **Partner** - Bring in HubSpot specialist, you lead strategy
4. **Expand** - If you want to build HubSpot practice

## Talking Points

**If it's not a fit:**
> "This is solid work, but it's really HubSpot implementation consulting. My sweet spot is GTM strategy and Clay-based automation - prospecting workflows, CRM enrichment, that kind of thing. For the technical HubSpot build, I'd recommend [partner name]. Happy to stay involved on the strategic advisory piece if that's helpful."

**If exploring partial scope:**
> "I'm most excited about the strategic advisory piece - the GTM model and attribution methodology work. That's where I can add the most value. For the technical HubSpot implementation, we might want to bring in a specialist who lives in that platform daily."

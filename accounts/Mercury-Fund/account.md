# Mercury Fund

Houston-based early-stage VC firm (Seed & Series A) focused on B2B SaaS. Founded 2005, $750M+ AUM across 5 funds. Known for their "Go Slow to Grow Fast" operational approach -- they embed GTM, product, and ops support directly into portfolio companies. Almost always lead or co-lead investor.

## Account Info

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Company | Mercury Fund |
| Industry | Venture Capital |
| Size | ~20 team members, 58+ portfolio companies |

| Website | mercuryfund.com |
| Clarify ID | 3eced213-20f4-4436-a8d7-0798f866a49d (Aileen) |

## ICP Fit

This isn't a direct buyer in the typical sense -- it's a **VC channel play**. Mercury advises 58+ B2B SaaS portcos on GTM. If Aileen sees value in the Clarify x Claude Code x Obsidian stack, she becomes a **multiplier** -- recommending the approach to founders across her portfolio.

- [ ] [[gtm-automation-buyer]] - Indirect fit (portco recommendations)
- [ ] [[enterprise-developer-tools]] - Indirect fit (dev tools are her investment thesis)

## Origin Event -- LinkedIn Trigger

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Post by:** Aileen Allen
**Engagement:** 34+ reactions, 31 comments, 2 reposts

Aileen posted about "the CRM wars" -- in the past week, 2 founders asked her what CRM their portcos are using, and she received 2 forwarded emails about HubSpot's 90% startup discount. She asked her network:

> "if you're early stage, and/or recently switched, what are you using?
> 1, hubspot
> 2, Attio
> 3, Clarify
> 4, SFDC
> 5, BYO w/ insert your preferred LLM or agent of choice
>  6, ...?"

She also mentioned Mercury's 2026 GTM survey is still live and she'll have trends soon.

**Willy's comment (2h after post):**
> "I'm using Clarify (record keeping) x Claude code (account strategy) x Obsidian (meeting prep/notes + architecture diagram building)"

**Why this matters:**
1. She's actively evaluating CRM for portcos -- this is a live buying signal
2. She named Clarify by name -- it's already on her radar
3. Willy commented with his exact stack -- she's seen his name
4. Her background is GTM ops (Atlassian, Vanta, Tailscale) -- she'd deeply understand the value
5. Mercury runs an annual GTM survey/report -- she's building a thesis around tooling trends
6. This is no longer truly cold -- there's a touchpoint

## Opportunity

**What they need:**
Mercury's portcos are actively evaluating CRM and GTM tooling right now. Aileen is fielding questions from founders about what to use. She's building a perspective (via the GTM survey and this LinkedIn post) on the best stack for early-stage B2B SaaS companies.

**Why now:**
- Aileen posted about CRM evaluation *today* (2026-02-05)
- 2 founders asked her this week what CRM to use
- Mercury's 2026 GTM survey is live -- she's actively collecting data
- HubSpot is aggressively discounting for startups (90% off first year) -- competitive pressure is creating urgency
- She's relatively new to VC (joined 2024) and is building her advisory playbook

**Budget signals:**
- N/A for direct purchase -- this is a channel/influence play
- Mercury has a CMO, COO, and CPO on staff who advise portcos on tooling decisions
- Mercury published a 2025 GTM Report and is building the 2026 version -- tooling recommendations are part of their portfolio value-add

## Key Insights

Aileen is not a CRM buyer -- she's a **CRM recommender** at scale. Getting her bought into the Clarify x Claude Code stack means access to 58+ B2B SaaS portcos who trust her GTM judgment.

Her Atlassian background means she understands:
- Product-led growth motions
- Developer tooling ecosystems
- How tools compound when integrated properly
- The difference between "CRM as a database" and "CRM as an intelligence layer"

The "BYO w/ LLM or agent of choice" option she listed (#5) is essentially what Willy's stack is. She's already thinking about this category.

## Outbound Strategy -- Key Angles

### Angle 1: LinkedIn DM (Warmest -- Recommended First Move)

She's seen Willy's comment. A short DM referencing the post and offering to walk her through the stack in action would feel natural, not salesy.

**Approach:** "Hey Aileen -- saw your CRM post and dropped a comment. I've been running Clarify x Claude Code x Obsidian for a few months now and it's changed how I do account strategy. Happy to show you how it works if you're curious -- might be useful context for your GTM survey too."

### Angle 2: Email (If DM doesn't land)

More structured -- lead with the GTM survey angle. Offer to share your stack as a data point for their research. Reference her PLG content to show you've done homework.

### Angle 3: Content Play (Longer game)

Engage consistently on her content. She posts about GTM, PLG, and tooling regularly. Build familiarity over 2-3 interactions before the ask.

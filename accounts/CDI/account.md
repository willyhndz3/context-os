# Constructive Dialogue Institute

Psychology-based nonprofit founded by Jonathan Haidt and Caroline Mehl (2017). Develops research-backed educational tools for communicating across differences. Flagship "Perspectives" program serves higher education.

## Account Info

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Company | Constructive Dialogue Institute |
| Industry | Education / Nonprofit |
| Size | Small nonprofit (grant-funded) |
| Primary Contact | Kristen Edge |
| Title | Systems & Operations Manager |
| Source | Referral from Charlie |
| Website | constructivedialogue.org |

## ICP Fit

Not a typical Clay workflow buyer. This is a **HubSpot infrastructure project**:
- [ ] [[gtm-automation-buyer]] - Partial fit (marketing ops focus)
- [ ] [[enterprise-developer-tools]] - No
- [ ] [[sample-icp-vp-sales]] - No

## Opportunity

**What they need:**
1. **Website Integration & Attribution** - Craft CMS ↔ HubSpot, form capture, UTM tracking
2. **Third-Party Integrations** - LinkedIn ads, Zoom webinars, conference QR attribution
3. **Reporting & Dashboards** - Marketing funnel, campaign attribution, sales KPIs
4. **Process Automation** - Renewal deal automation, data capture workflows
5. **Strategic Advisory** - GTM model partnership, attribution methodology

**Why now:**
- Grant received specifically for expansion work
- 5-month funded engagement window
- Must begin before end of March 2026

**Budget signals:**
- Grant-funded (external budget secured)
- 5-month scope indicates significant investment
- Multiple workstreams = substantial project

## Key Insights

**From Discovery Call (2026-02-02):**

Kristen architected their current HubSpot but top-of-funnel/attribution was never properly set up. The previous marketing person left, then they worked with a contractor, and now they need to get serious about tracking.

> "We don't have very much in the middle and there's a lot of ambiguity as far as how much information is actually coming through the website. It could be a hundred percent. It could be like 50% of our pages are actually coming through. We just have no idea."
> [VERIFIED: transcript:16:11-16:29]

**Two-Contractor Model:** They're open to splitting work between a strategy person (for CGO on attribution methodology) and a technical person (for integrations). This works in our favor.

**Tool Stack Update:**
- Just signed **1-year Apollo contract** - Clay is off the table
- Using Airtable for program/training management
- Fillout forms (considering switch back to HubSpot native)
- Zoom native integration has issues

**What resonated:**
- Showed eSmart deep research agent in Apollo - demonstrated capability
- Process-first philosophy ("tooling shouldn't limit us")
- Transparency about attribution reporting not being core expertise

**CGO Involvement:** Chief Growth Officer will review everything and be involved in strategic decisions

## Timeline

| Date | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2026-01-29 | Booked meeting | Referral from Charlie |
| 2026-02-02 | Discovery call | Good conversation, showed eSmart agent |
| ~2026-02-16 | Decision expected | Within 2 weeks |
| End of March | Must start | Grant deadline |

## Project Scope (from requirements doc)

### 1. Website Integration & Attribution
- Validate Craft CMS ↔ HubSpot connection
- Tracking code + cookie consent
- Form capture + property mapping (UTMs)
- Page/CTA tracking, referral attribution
- Fillout forms integration vs HubSpot native

### 2. Third-Party Integrations
- LinkedIn + ad platform connections (lead gen sync, UTM structure)
- Zoom integration fixes (webinar sync, attendance automation)
- Conference attribution (tablet/QR capture, asset tracking)

### 3. Reporting & Dashboards
- Marketing performance (traffic, CTAs, forms, email, social)
- Lead funnel (visitor → lead → MQL → SQL → customer by source)
- Campaign + attribution reporting
- Sales KPIs (renewal rate, expansion, key account coverage)
- Marketing sourced/influenced pipeline

### 4. Process Automation
- Renewal deal automation (copy line items - API issues)
- Data capture for new KPIs

### 5. Strategic Advisory
- GTM model thought partnership
- Attribution model selection
- Define "marketing sourced/influenced" methodology

## Fit Assessment

**Strong fit for:**
- Integration/connectivity work (Craft CMS, Fillout, LinkedIn, Zoom → HubSpot)
- Apollo workflows (they just signed 1-year contract)
- Make.com orchestration layer

**Not a fit for:**
- Multi-touch attribution reporting/dashboards
- Complex weighted attribution methodology

**Best path forward:**
- Position for integrations piece in two-contractor model
- Find network referral for attribution/reporting expert
- Could be a good project to expand into HubSpot integration work

**Status:** Evaluation - awaiting decision (~2 weeks)
**Next:**
1. Research connectivity/API approach for their stack
2. Find attribution reporting expert in network
3. Sent recording to Kristen

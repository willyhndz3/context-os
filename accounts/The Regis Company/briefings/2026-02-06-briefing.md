## Relationship History

**How it started:** Charlie reached out in Oct 2025 wanting help with DevLearn conference outreach. You proposed a quick win - scoring/filtering a list against their ICP in Clay, pulling 200-300 L&D contacts.

**Phase 1 (Completed):**
- CRM enrichment project in HubSpot
- Focus: "title" and "company size" fields
- 12,700 contacts (96% lacked LinkedIn URLs)
- Prioritized their 4,000 true ICP contacts
- 12-hour not-to-exceed estimate, flexible billing
- Holly signed proposal before Dec 4 kick-off
- Used Slack for comms, dedicated channel

**What went well:**
- Delivered enriched DevLearn/ELE contact list that "meets outreach needs"
- Strong rapport with Charlie
- Holly explicitly mentioned exploring additional budget in 2026

---

## Current Context: Phase 2

The meeting Friday is to **scope Phase 2 of data enrichment**.

From the recent email thread (today, Feb 4):
- Holly requested this meeting to discuss Phase 2
- Minor W9 issue with Jillian has been resolved
- They're ready to move forward

**Phase 1 covered:** Company-level data (company size) + contact-level (titles, segmentation)

**Phase 2 likely scope (to confirm):**
- Additional enrichment fields (industry, partner/reseller status)?
- Net new contact enrichment?
- Ongoing integration/maintenance?
- Expansion to other data sources?

---

## Likely Discussion Topics

1. **What worked in Phase 1** - Get feedback, validate approach
2. **Phase 2 scope** - What additional enrichment do they need?
3. **Budget/timeline** - Holly mentioned "additional budget for 2026"
4. **Ongoing relationship** - Retainer vs. project-based?

---

## Watch Out For

| Potential Concern | How to Address |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Scope creep** | Define clear deliverables upfront, keep not-to-exceed model |
| **Tool subscription costs** | They upgraded Clay to Pro for Phase 1 - check if they want to maintain that level |
| **Timeline pressure** | Ask about any upcoming campaigns/events driving urgency |

*Note: No pricing objection history with this account - they're a good fit and value-aligned.*

## Talking Points

**Value you've delivered:**
- Cleaned and enriched their CRM data
- Enabled persona segmentation for targeted outreach
- DevLearn campaign list delivered successfully

**For Phase 2:**
- "What gaps are you still seeing in the data?"
- "Any new campaigns or events coming up that need list support?"
- "Do you want to keep Clay Pro running, or batch enrichment as needed?"

**Expansion opportunity:**
- They're an L&D company - potentially need ongoing event-based list building (trade shows, conferences)
- Could propose a lightweight retainer for quarterly campaigns

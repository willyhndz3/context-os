| Date | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Jan 2026 | Discovery | Identified deep research use case |

## Outcome

**Result:** Won - Active engagement

**Learnings:**
- Enterprise accounts with public financials are ideal for deep research agents
- Persona segmentation (CEO vs CFO vs Ops) significantly improves response
- Consultant-style tone works better than "sales-y" copy

## Expansion Opportunity

Brett texted asking for:
1. **Self-sufficiency documentation** - How to operate the system independently
2. **Standalone agents guide** - How to use and modify the research agents
3. **Scaling playbook** - How to replicate for other reps on his team

**Their scaling pattern:**
- One state at a time
- ~10 utilities per state
- High-quality contacts + personalized messages
- Same deep research agent approach as Texas

**Deliverable committed:** Notion doc for Brett, his boss, and wider team covering the full workflow and scaling approach.

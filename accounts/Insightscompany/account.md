Lost opportunity that informed pricing objection handling and deal qualification criteria.

## Account Info

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Company | Insightscompany |
| Industry | SaaS |
| Size | Early stage |
| Primary Contact | Sravanthi |

## ICP Fit

- [x] [[gtm-automation-buyer]] (partial fit - tactical buyer)
- [ ] [[enterprise-developer-tools]]
- [ ] [[sample-icp-vp-sales]]

## Opportunity

**What they need:**
- Optimization of existing GTM infrastructure
- List building improvements

**Why now:**
- Evaluating multiple contractors

**Budget signals:**
- Rate concern was primary driver
- Initially suggested $100/hr (vs. $125/hr standard)
- Agreed to meet at $115/hr but still went cheaper

## Key Insights

This account taught important lessons about qualification and pricing.

> "Insights Company expressed concern about the consulting rate, initially suggesting $100/hr due to budget constraints, but Willy has agreed to meet in the middle at $115/hr."
> [VERIFIED: Insightscompany deal]

> "After considering a few options, I've decided to move forward with another contractor for our initial GTM needs at this time... we're just in a unique position right now, since we have some existing infra and primarily want to explore optimizations"
> [VERIFIED: Insightscompany loss - Jan 2026]

## Red Flags (for future qualification)

- "Existing infra, primarily want optimizations" = tactical, not strategic
- Rate was first topic, not value
- Evaluating 3+ contractors on price
- Small scope with no expansion potential

## Timeline

| Date | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Jan 2026 | Discovery | Rate concern surfaced early |
| Jan 2026 | Negotiation | Met at $115/hr |
| Jan 2026 | Lost | Went with cheaper contractor |

## Outcome

**Result:** Lost to cheaper competitor

**Learnings:**
1. Don't negotiate rate down for tactical buyers - let them go
2. "Existing infra + optimizations" = disqualification signal
3. Price-first conversations rarely convert profitably
4. Graceful exit preserves relationship for future

## How It Relates

- [[pricing-objection]] - Source of evidence for objection handling
- [[lost-deal-followup]] - Created this pattern based on this loss
- [[gtm-automation-buyer]] - Informs disqualification criteria for this ICP

## Relationship History

**Jan 26, 2026 - First Call (30 min)**
- James reached out via cal.com booking
- Discussed outbound automation strategies and enrichment workflows
- Pain points: email deliverability with enterprise accounts, contact coverage gaps
- You shared architecture examples, enrichment tactics, and consulting pricing

**Key Decisions Made:**
- You offered to scope an outbound enrichment automation project (~10 hours at $125/hr)
- James expressed interest in layering additional enrichment providers (like Clay) to improve contact coverage
- You offered to connect James with a LinkedIn ads expert from your network
- Both agreed multi-channel outbound (LinkedIn, phone, email) is necessary given email deliverability challenges with large enterprises

---

## Current Context

- **No formal deal created yet** - This is follow-up to exploratory conversation
- James is the GTM lead at a small, well-funded developer tools company
- They're trying to scale outbound but hitting classic deliverability walls with enterprise targets
- They may have been evaluating options since the first call (9 days ago)

**Open from last call:**
- Your proposal/scope for the enrichment automation project
- Potential LinkedIn ads expert introduction

---

## Likely Discussion Topics

Based on ICP patterns and last conversation:

1. **Project scope decision** - Are they ready to move forward with the ~$1,250 engagement?
2. **Enrichment provider selection** - Clay vs. alternatives, cost/coverage tradeoffs
3. **Multi-channel strategy** - LinkedIn + phone + email coordination
4. **HeyReach API integration** - Discussed exploring this last time
5. **LinkedIn ads intro** - Did they want the connection you offered?

---

## Watch Out For

Potential objections or concerns based on patterns:

| Potential Concern | How to Address |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Rate sensitivity | Small team, may push on $125/hr. Offer scoped alternatives or $115/hr for right fit. |
| "We're handling it ourselves" | Common with GTM leads. Position as force multiplier, not replacement. |
| "Let's start smaller" | Good - offer 2-3 hour audit or single use case coaching ($500) |
| Enterprise deliverability skepticism | This is real. Validate the pain, discuss multi-channel as solution. |

## Talking Points

Key value props relevant to Eraser:

- **Developer tools ICP fit** - You've worked with similar companies (WSO2, developer-focused products)
- **Multi-source enrichment expertise** - Exactly what they need for coverage gaps
- **Strategy-first approach** - Important for GTM lead who needs to justify tooling spend
- **Quick wins possible** - 10-hour engagement can deliver tangible workflow they keep

**Proof point to share:**
> "At The Regis Company, we started with a single $1K list enrichment project that expanded into ongoing work."

## Open Questions to Ask

- [ ] Have you made progress on the enrichment provider decision since we last talked?
- [ ] What's the timeline pressure - any specific campaigns or targets driving urgency?
- [ ] Is there budget allocated for this quarter, or does this need internal approval?
- [ ] Who else is involved in the decision (just you, or is there a founder/VP weighing in)?
- [ ] Did you want that LinkedIn ads expert intro we discussed?

---

## Recommended Approach

1. **Open with relationship check** - "How's things at Eraser since we last talked?"
2. **Understand current state** - Have they tried anything new? What's working/not?
3. **Clarify decision criteria** - Budget, timeline, who else involved?
4. **Propose clear next step** - Either start the scoped project or offer smaller entry point
5. **Don't oversell** - James knows GTM. Be consultative, not salesy.

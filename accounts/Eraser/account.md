## ICP Fit

- [x] [[knowledge_base/icp/gtm-automation-buyer]]
- [x] [[knowledge_base/icp/enterprise-developer-tools]]

## Opportunity

**What they need:**
- HeyReach API integration for personalized LinkedIn outreach
- Multi-channel outbound (email blocked by enterprise gateways)
- Enrichment waterfall to improve contact coverage

**Why now:**
- Email deliverability to enterprise accounts is broken
- 7,000 signups/day but only ~30 qualify as outbound targets
- Need to maximize LinkedIn/phone since email doesn't work

**Budget signals:**
- Small team, may be price sensitive
- Proposed ~10 hours at $125/hr ($1,250)

## Key Insights

**From discovery call (Jan 26, 2026):**

> "Even following every best practice - tons of mailboxes, only 10-15 emails per day per mailbox - it's still not working. Those secure email gateways are no joke."
> [VERIFIED: Eraser call, Jan 26, 2026]

> "For us, LinkedIn and phone calls have been the most successful"
> [VERIFIED: Eraser call, Jan 26, 2026]

**Their current process:**
- 7,000 signups/day from Intercom
- Filter by region → ~2,000
- Enrich via Apollo CSV → ~20% get titles
- Filter by ICP → ~100/day
- Filter by company size → ~20-30 quality leads/day

**Pain points:**
- Apollo API enrichment yields less than CSV upload
- Personal emails from signups hard to enrich
- Enterprise email gateways block outbound

## Potential Services

- HeyReach API integration (push personalized messages at scale)
- Enrichment waterfall to improve coverage
- Multi-channel orchestration strategy

## Timeline

## Revenue Model

### Affiliate Commissions (All Tiers)
- **20% of first 12 months** of referred customer's subscription
- Tracked via Rewardful affiliate link
- Available to all partner tiers

### Deal Registration (Enterprise)
- For enterprise leads: $50k+ deal size, 300+ employees, US/CAN/UK/EU
- Higher commission rates than affiliate for qualified enterprise deals
- Studio & Elite Studio partners prioritized

### Payment Terms
- Payment issued **30 days after customer payment**

## Referral Process

### Self-Serve Leads
Use your Rewardful affiliate link. No registration needed.

### Enterprise Leads (Deal Registration)
Submit via Partner Portal. Key criteria:
- **Net-new customer** (not existing Clay customer)
- **Documented qualifying activity** (discovery call, demo, etc.)
- **$50k+ deal size** for enterprise
- **300+ employees**, US/CAN/UK/EU

### Registration Rules
- Valid for **90 days**
- Must show progress within **30 days**
- Studio & Elite partners get priority routing

### Revocation Triggers
- 60+ days with no progress
- Partner unresponsiveness
- Customer dissatisfaction
- Misrepresentation of Clay capabilities

## Co-Sell Process (Studio & Elite Only)

### Methodology: Follow-the-Leader
Whoever sources the deal leads the commercial motion.

### Three Engagement Models

1. **Open Evaluation** -- Multiple partners compete; Clay recommends 2-3 based on merit
2. **Exclusive Co-sell** -- Single partner gets full Clay GTM Engineering (GTME) support
3. **Standard referral** -- Partner refers, Clay handles the rest

### 5-Step Co-Sell Flow
1. **Submit** -- Partner submits deal via Partner Portal
2. **Review** -- Clay reviews fit and assigns
3. **Approval** -- Deal approved for co-sell engagement
4. **Engage** -- Joint selling with Clay GTME support
5. **Close** -- Deal closes, commission paid

## Accreditation Path

### Phase 1: Product Training
- 2+ employees complete training (1 must be exec-level)
- Each earns 2 Clay certifications

### Phase 2: Go-to-Market Alignment
- Align partner profile with Clay positioning
- Identify 10 target accounts
- Joint co-sell on initial deals
- Complete mock demo
- Train your team on Clay delivery

### Phase 3: Client Validation
- 2+ client references
- Technical review by Clay
- CSAT survey score of **4.0+ required**

### After Accreditation
- Begin receiving Clay-sourced leads
- Access to co-sell pipeline (Studio & Elite)

## Rules of Engagement

### Do
- Maintain certifications current
- Communicate proactively on Slack
- Deliver excellence on every engagement
- Align with GTME/Growth Strategist before recommending scope or strategy changes
- Use evidence-based claims only
- Use assigned tier badge + "Clay Solutions Partner" branding

### Don't
- Misrepresent Clay capabilities
- Bid on Clay-related paid ad terms
- Use Clay logo without written approval
- Make unsubstantiated claims (no "#1 Clay agency" etc.)

### Violations
- **Three strikes policy** for minor violations
- **Immediate removal** for severe misconduct

## Ongoing Requirements (Post-Accreditation)

| Requirement | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| Certification or cohort | Every 6 months |
| Refer a lead OR close a co-sell | Every 6 months / 12 months |
| Partner team syncs | Monthly (quarterly after 3 months) |
| Co-sell syncs | Biweekly (monthly after first quarter) |

**Failure to meet activity requirements** = loss of Clay-sourced lead access.

## How It Relates

- [[clay-workflow-service]] -- The GTM Factory's service offering built on Clay; this file covers the vendor *relationship*, not the service itself
- [[gtm-automation-buyer]] -- ICP segment that maps to Clay enterprise deal registration opportunities
